        "description":"""
        This specialized dish keeps your gecko's enclosure moist but a special serpentine - pattern breaks up the surface of the water so crickets and geckos can move over it un-impeded.
        Leopard Geckos, being native desert-dwellers, seem to prefer this type of water dish compared to the 'open pond' style. "That pond could have hungry fish or snakes in it!", thinks the gecko to herself cautiously... But with this water dish she fearlessly approaches the rocky shallows and takes a lil sip! During the day, I keep finding my geckos standing over their new water dishes, presumably keeping their toes cool!
        Order includes one Auto Refilling Leopard Gecko Water Dish.
        **Bottle not included unless you ask! I will happily include a water bottle for free but only upon request!**
        These WASHABLE dishes clean up easily warm water and reptile safe soap. Very hot water is not typically required, if you use very hot water (near boiling) be gentle with the plastic as it may soften while very hot. Don't worry, it will harden again once it's cool enough for a gecko to enjoy but be gentle while it's very hot. We recommend washing this product weekly (even though the bottle may stay full longer).
        I make these beauties with my customized 3D printer out of PETG plastic and PLA plastic in Rochester, NY.
        PETG is the same type of plastic used to make water bottles. PLA plastic is comprised of tough fibers from plants like sugar cane or corn. Both of these materials will hold up for years in a Gecko environment. Stroodies stands behind all of our products because we have our own geckos and we love them very much.

        We're proud to present you with our 3D printed magnetic chameleon feeder! Our feeder sandwiches the screen of your chameloen's cage between small yet powerful magnets. The chameleon feeder will hold over 300 grams making it the perfect feeder for all chameleon species except Meller's and Parson's chameleons!
        Simply attach the chameleon feeder where you would like it, dump in your feeder insect of choice, then watch them crawl around on the screen while your chameleon gets a meal! Mealworms, superworms, and small to medium dubia roaches are unable to escape the feeder! Of course you could put crickets in it but they will eventually do what crickets do and hop out.
        Our products are designed with durability in mind! All of our magnetic products have the magnets completely encased in plastic meaning that they will never corrode! Our chameleon feeders are made with a plant-based plastic commonly referred to as PLA. We also only source our filament from quality manufacturers in the US and Europe; no Amazon mystery filament for us!
        Our magnetic chameleon feeder measures 150mm x 110mm x 60 mm (approximately 5 7/8" x 4 5/16" x 2 5/16")
        ***Our magnetic chameleon feeder will only work on screen terrarium, not on glass terrariums***

        "title":'Bamboo Bridge - 4" Width',
        "price":14.00,
        "details":'["Handmade", "Materials: Bamboo, Paracord"]',
        "description":"""
        They are made out of bamboo and paracord making them mold resistant and great for humid enclosures as well as desert enclosures. As long as the bridge has a chance to dry out each day, there will be no issue. If you have an enclosure that stays above 80% humidity and has very little airflow, we recommend the full paracord bridges instead.  The 4" width is perfect for midsize reptiles, including Crested Geckos, Chahouas, and young Leachies. The Bridge width is 4" with the two end pieces being 6".
        **Typically ships withing 7-10 days after the order is placed. If order more than one product, it may take a few additional days to make before shipping.
        **Bamboo comes in all sorts of widths and is cut down for these bridges. The pieces of bamboo may vary in color and size from stick to stick within the bridge. Because we cut them by hand, the ends may not always be a perfect straight cut. We always make sure that we smooth out any rough edges before using the bamboo in our bridges. There may be burn marks by the knotted edge of the bridge as well. We have to burn the paracord edges to round them off after completing the bridge, so sometimes the bamboo will have slight burns on it where the ends meet. We glue the bamboo to the paracord using a water and heat resistant glue that is 100% safe for animals. This keeps the bamboo in place and extends the life of the bridge.
