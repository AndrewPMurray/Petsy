        "title": 'Starlight Cafe© birdfeeder Large cypress 8 Sided fly through bird feeder, thick cedar shingles/copper platform',
        "price": 189.00,
        "details": '["Handmade", "Materials: mahogany, cypress, copper"]',
        "description": """
        Hand made entirely in Atlanta GA with very thick moisture resistant domestic and tropical woods supported by recycled PVC at the base for year round service to the birds without any fear of rotting in humid or dry climates.
        The Walls:
        The walls are hand cut from full 1 inch thick Georgia swamp cypress, kiln dried to allow the paint to adhere for a lifetime of beauty. We use four coats of the best quality exterior grade enamel paint available.
        The Perches:
        The perches are hand routed from East African mahogany. As a tropical wood it is well suited for years of year round exposure to the elements and provides a striking contrast to the white painted cypress to which it is attached. We all love the unmistakable grain of mahogany.
        The Shingles:
        The shingles are heavy-cut western red cedar from British Columbia which I cut 1/4 inches thick (shingles from other makers are often cut paper-thin less than 1/8 inch, like tongue depressors) so no curling or degrading will occur. Using a band saw I have been hand cutting these shingles at the same thickness using the same method for 19 years. These shingles require no treatment such as water seal or linseed oil. Simply allow the roof to breath and you will enjoy the scallop look for many years. The roof is further enhanced with dazzling one inch wide copper strips on the edge of each of the eight roof panels with each attached with solid copper boat nails from Norway. Quite an elegant little touch.
        The Base:
        The underlying base and supports are made from polywood (thermoformed recycled plastic). Help our planet in every way you can.
        Weighing in at 19 pounds with thick one inch walls and heavy cut shingles (again one quarter inch thick) this feeder will last a lifetime.
        "Built like a Tank"™ has always been our motto at Southern Bird Gardens™. And rightly so, lifting this up in your arms takes quite a feat of strength!
        The Starlight Cafe© is octagonal with dimensions of 15" wide and 29" tall. This unit will simply rest over the top of any standard 4X4 post ( dimensionally 3 1/2" by 3 1/2" ) easily found at any home center.
        There is no requirement for attachment to the post. The wind will not lift this heavy feeder from the post. Should you wish to add a set screw you can.
        Comes with post mount built in. Post not included.
        You'll find an included 10 inch replaceable plant tray lining the inside of this feeder. This serves as a seed holder for the birds. To clean periodically simply bend the tray with your fingers and remove, rinse and reinsert. To clean the outside simply spray with a garden hose or use a Clorox hand wipe, any brand will do. Easy peasy....
        Your bird friends will simply love the Starlight Cafe©.
