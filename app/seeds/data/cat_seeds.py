            What to Expect
            Catnip is considered to be nonaddictive and completely harmless to cats. When cats smell catnip they exhibit several behaviors: They may rub their heads and body on the herb or jump, roll around, vocalize and salivate. This response lasts for about 10 minutes, after which the cat becomes temporarily immune to catnip's effects for roughly 30 minutes. Response to catnip is hereditary; about 70 to 80 percent of cats exhibit this behavior in the plant's presence. In addition, catnip does not affect kittens until they are about six months old and begin to reach sexual maturity.

            Original design and hand knitted. All Materials are safe to baby, so safe to our baby cats.
            Underage cats grow faster, so it is recommended to choose one bigger size.
            For example, a cat over 4 months weighs 2.2 kg. Due to its growth so fast, it is recommended to choose size M.
            For our experience and plus the shipping time, we suggest the cat under 4 months, choose M, the adult cat choose either L or XL.
            As we all know that the skin of hairless cat is like a baby and needs protection well. All fabrics in our studio are selected strictly and all clothes are hand-made and can be customized. Cats will not have any allergic reactions when wearing our products. There are many cats in our studio who are our best inspectors. The clothes are washable. The pure cotton fabric may pilling after being worn for a period of time. That's because the cat's tongue is prickly and always loves to lick. It‚Äôs not a matter of clothes or material.
